## CS210-Course-Project

# Introduction
Steam is the largest platform for purchasing and playing games 
on the PC platform today. Launched on September 12, 2003, Steam 
has gained a lot of users since then and I am one of them. I opened my 
Steam account on February 28, 2016, and I have accumulated a lot of 
data on this platform over the past 8 years. 
In this project, I will seek answers to my hypothesis and research 
questions by using my data on Steam. Moreover, to achieve these 
goals, I will use learning methods such as regression and random 
forest methods.
